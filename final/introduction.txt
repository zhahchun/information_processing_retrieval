“Another day, another case,” you say to yourself as you drive past the mansion’s gate with the sun high in the sky. 
The driveway bows out into a circle along with a swarm of police cars. You exit your car and see the words “Regal Estates” stamped into the driveway.
One of the most well-known families for centuries. 
“Detective sir, the premise has been secured and the suspects are right over here in the courtyard. Only one death; the master of the house. Cause of death: poisoned tea. Here’s our file for our questioning, though it’s only their background. The mansion is ready for your investigation,” says the police officer. 
After thanking him, you walk towards the courtyard and see the suspects. 
-There’s the ex-wife, a woman whose spending basically forced the divorce. The file notes that she did not get the divorce alimony. On her face, you can see only a single tear descending.
-A French cook, who is desperately crying over his master’s death. He seems to have no papers at all. An illegal immigrant…
-The mansion servant. A mysterious man, but carries himself well. His eyes dart back and forth in thought. Could he be trying to think of who is the culprit?
-Last of all, the son dressed head-to-toe in designer brands. He seems indifferent, but he seems to be the most on edge.
It is up to me to figure out this mystery. Where should I start first?
